# MyGem

This is me trying to creating ruby gem with bundler using Docker as development environment.

## Installation

Build a local copy of our gem:

    $rake build

Then install it from your local copy:

    $gem install pkg/my_gem-0.0.1.gem 

## Development

After checking out the repo, 

Run docker container. 

    $docker-compose run --rm app /bin/sh

Run the tests.   

    $bundle exec rake spec
